# Python-Plane-Shape-Area-Calculator

This Python script allows users to calculate the area of various plane shapes: square, rectangle, circle, and triangle. It prompts the user to enter the desired shape and then collects the necessary parameters (e.g., dimensions) for the calculation. The script then calculates and displays the area of the chosen shape.

**Supported Shapes:**
**o** Square
**o** Rectangle
**o** Circle
**o** Triangle
**Usage:**
1.Run the script.
2.Enter the name of the shape you want to calculate the area for (e.g., "circle").
3.Provide the required dimensions or parameters as prompted.
4.The script will calculate and display the area of the chosen shape.
**Example Usage:**
**o** Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5 cm.
**o** Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 6 cm and a height of 8 cm.
This simple Python script is useful for quick area calculations of common plane shapes.
